PyDataTable is intended to provide a representation similar to a database table - a list of table rows 
	where each row contains a set of key-value pairs, sharing common keys (internally represented by a 
	list of dicts).  It includ several capabilities common to database tables as well as many other 
	nice-to-have capabilities.  
Some of the capabilities include:	
	Selecting columns - including filtering selected columns by column content and adding columns populated by the result of some expression
	Filtering rows by some criteria
	Joining multiple tables (including database table-join, and concatenating rows)
	bucketing and aggregating of bucketed results
	de-duplication (e.g. select distinct)
	sorting
	diffing of two tables
